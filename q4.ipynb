    "\n",
    "As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:\n",

    ".X....\n",
    "```\n",
    "The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:\n",

    "MXMXAXMASX\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:\n",

    "```\n",
